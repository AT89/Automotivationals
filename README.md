This was one of the coolest pens ive ever seen
trying to make it for WP, i want to strip out the first 4 characters of the title, cant figure out how... will be a WIP

-- For one of the first day-labs at GA, we were learning how to use APIs and I found out that you can take any reddit subreddit and add .json at the end and turn it into a JSON. I made an image displayer but Boylett made this amazing idea. All props to him!
